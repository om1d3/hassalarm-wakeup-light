## üîß Contributing Code

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/hassalarm-wakeup-light.git
   cd hassalarm-wakeup-light
   ```

3. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Guidelines

#### YAML Configuration

```yaml
# Use 2 spaces for indentation
automation:
  - alias: "Clear, Descriptive Names"
    description: "Explain what this does"
    trigger:
      - trigger: template
        value_template: "{{ ... }}"
    # Add comments for complex logic
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: input_boolean.example
        state: "on"
    action:
      - action: light.turn_on
        target:
          entity_id: light.bedroom  # Use descriptive entity names
```

#### Best Practices

- **Use descriptive names** for entities and aliases
- **Add comments** explaining complex logic
- **Test thoroughly** in a real Home Assistant setup
- **Validate YAML** before committing
- **Keep it simple** - prefer clarity over cleverness
- **Make it configurable** - use variables where possible

### Testing Your Changes

Before submitting:

1. **Test in Home Assistant**
   - Does it work as expected?
   - No errors in logs?
   - Automations trigger correctly?

2. **Validate YAML**
   - Use Home Assistant's YAML validator
   - Check syntax online: https://www.yamllint.com/

3. **Test edge cases**
   - What if device is offline?
   - What if alarm is cancelled?
   - What if Home Assistant restarts?

4. **Update documentation**
   - Add to README.md if needed
   - Update examples/
   - Add to CHANGELOG.md
